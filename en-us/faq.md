# Frequently Asked Questions

## Formatting

Use `&` symbol to indicate a formatting code. E.g., &a will format as green, &l will format as bold.

Use \` to quote text with spaces. E.g., \`Text with space\`. You may also need this when fill in values in powers.

## Language / i18n

The plugin has been refactored many times to make it more efficient and easy to maintain, therefore the language file is everywhere incomplete.

To customize the language and messages, copy `en_US.template.yml` to `en_US.custom.yml` and add/edit language entries as needed in the new file.

If you are getting errors like `MISSING_LANG` that is indicating language entry is missing. Use the above method to add it.

Please help us update the language file! If you are interested, please fork [our repo](https://github.com/NyaaCat/RPGItems-reloaded) and edit file `RPGItems-reloaded/src/main/resources/lang/en_US.yml`.
